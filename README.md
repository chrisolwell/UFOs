# UFOs

### Overview
There have been hundreds of UFO sightings around the globe throughout the years and they all have one thing in common: none of them were shaped like a cube. I know because I have created a tool to sift through data on UFO sightings, and I searched for cube-shaped UFOs.

Our purpose was to more easily filter and understand UFO sightings, not to find out if any are shaped like cubes; learning that Aliens aren't flying cube-shaped space ships is merely a fortuitous byproduct. 

### Analysis

I built a website to to filter through sighting data based on the date, location of the sighting and the shape of the UFO. To do so I need to use html and javascript, as well as CSS. The site is a tool that allows us to make sense of data that would otherwise be vast and unweildy. But simply entering a value into a search filter will instantly return the relevant data. It's pretty tight yall.

### Conclusions
But it is not without limits. For one thing, the input to the search field must match exactly the value in the data or the tool will not find what the user is searching for. Looking for a sighting in Pennsylvania? If you don't enter "pa" in the field that filters the data by state, you will not get an accurate return. And oh by the way, it's case-sensative. If you search for sightings in "PA" you will not get an accurate return. It's way too easy to get an innaccurate return from this tool, but it could probably be fixed without too much trouble so that case-sensativity was inconsequential. 

It's still pretty cool though, and the site looks nice.
